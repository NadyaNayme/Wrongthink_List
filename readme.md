# wrongthink_list
if your project uses any words in this list you are a bad person and should feel bad, baddie


## additional things to avoid

- acronyms should only be used after the acronym has been defined at least once in material because people who are unfamiliar with the acronyms may feel excluded
- difficult words and "lingo" or "jargon" should be avoided - stick with simple, plain language
- contractions should be avoided
- hard stops ("periods") should be avoided
- capital letters should be avoided
