# wrongthink_list
if your project uses any words in this list you are a bad person and should feel bad. baddie.


## additional things to avoid

- acronyms should only be used after the acronym has been defined at least once in material. people who are unfamiliar with the acronyms may feel excluded.
- difficult words and "lingo" should be avoided - stick with simple, plain language
- contractions should be avoided
